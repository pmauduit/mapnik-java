# Purpose

This is a simple tileserver based on Spring and the libmapnik JNI bindings.

# Requirements

the Mapnik library will be needed, as this is all this PoC is about. Under
debian unstable, as of writing this note, the setup can be performed issuing
the following command:

```
# apt install libmapnik3.1
```

The `mapnik-jni` bindings for mapnik 3 will be needed. The original authors of
Mapnik do not maintain such a tool, but there is a one available here:

```
 git@github.com:jlnr/mapnik-jni.git
```

Once cloned, the repository will require the `libmapnik3.0-dev` package. Then a
simple `make` will result in the `build/dist/libmapnik-jni.so` file to be
generated.

Copy this `libmapnik-jni.so` to `/usr/lib/jni/` directory, the
`libmapnik-jni.jar` into `/usr/share/java`, then you should be done with the
mapnik bindings setup.

# Data

Using `osm2pgsql`, load a postgis database, then edit the file `simplemap.xml`,
the postgresql configuration around line 140 to adapt to your setup.


# Launch

```
$ mvn jetty:run
```

Then a minimalist webserver should be available at
`http://localhost:8080/demo`.

# Caveats

This is not much than a Proof-of-Concept ! Do not expect to use it in
production, as there is no caching of the generated tiles, which can take ~ 1
minute on my computer to render ...
